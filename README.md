This Flutter application's basic idea is to ask a question, choose the correct answer, and upon completion of the questions in each stage,
the number of correct and incorrect questions is calculated, and an evaluation is given for them. So far, it contains 3 sections of questions,
and they will be modified later, adding some other sections, and adding more diverse questions. Try it now. Explore its features.

I will leave you some pictures
